cookies.html: yummy! chocolate chips.
chocolate.html: do you want to eat or to play?
play.html: then go back and play.
amazing... how did i not find this when I checked the cookies before?  there is a cookie called "info" with value "you+should+have+followed+busynothing..."
going to http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/linkedlist.php?busynothing=12345 shows the message:

If you came here from level 4 - go back!
You should follow the obvious chain...

http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/linkedlist.php?busynothing=
and the next busynothing is 92512
last number yields "that's it."
