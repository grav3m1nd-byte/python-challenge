image: swans
title: can you tell the difference?
source comment: it is more obvious that what you might think

let's try to use PIL to compute the difference of the two images

the difference is just a blurry dark version.  about what you'd expect.  no hidden message.

waste of time - turns out you need to guess and check until you try the url "bright.html" - which gives "ness".  so, it's really "brightness.html"

the page is the same as balloons.html, but the source comment says "maybe consider deltas.gz"

what a waste of time - nothing to do with python.
