went to html.zip
source clue:
	yes. find the zip.
there's a zip file at channel.zip
download it ...it has 910 files.  last one is "readme.txt"
contents of readme.txt:
	welcome to my zipped list.
	
	hint1: start from 90052
	hint2: answer is inside the zip

opening 90052 says "Next nothing is 90052"
following the sequence, the last one says "collect the comments"
doing that, and concatenating them, we get a string ascii art that says "hockey"
i go to hockey.html and i see "it's in the air. look at the letters. "
i look at the letters in hockey and they're written in "oxygen"

oxygen.html
